# ðŸª· Filecoin Playground

Sandbox environment for tinkering with Filecoin related tools and projects.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to run a Lotus Lite node.

```bash
FULLNODE_API_INFO=wss://wss.node.glif.io/apigw/lotus lotus daemon --lite
```

Now you can start running commands against the node.

```bash
lotus state power
```
